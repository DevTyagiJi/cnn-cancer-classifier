# 🧠 CNN-Based Histopathology Image Classifier

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify histopathology images of breast tissue as **cancerous** or **normal**. Built using TensorFlow and Grad-CAM for visual interpretability.

## 🚀 Features
- Binary classification using CNN  
- Image preprocessing & augmentation  
- Grad-CAM heatmaps for explainability  
- Easy prediction on custom images

## 🗂️ Dataset Structure
histopathology/  
├── cancer/  
└── normal/

## ⚙️ How to Use
pip install -r requirements.txt  
python train.py         → Train the model  
python predict.py       → Predict a new image  
python gradcam.py       → Generate heatmaps

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Deploy as a web app  
- Add multi-class support  
- Use pretrained models (Transfer Learning)
